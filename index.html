    <p>In an effort to <a href="https://www.residentadvisor.net/features/3641" target="_blank">Save our Scene</a>, <strong>925</strong> was conceived as a virtual club intended for the workday.</p>

    <p>We'll bring you uninterrupted livestreamed sets, 40 hours a week, and pay the DJs for their time. These folks are currently facing dire prospects as the clubs are closed, festivals are canceled, and the future of clubbing remains uncertain.</p>

    <h2 class="faq-title">more details:</h2>

    <article class="question">
      <h3>How much will it cost?</h3>
      <p>The recommended price is $10/mo but we will operate on a pay-what-you-can sliding scale. Consider paying what you normally spend going to clubs each month.</p>
    </article>

    <article class="question">
      <h3>How is my money being spent?</h3>

      <p>We feel deep gratitude for all the DJs that have spent their time raising money for others during the COVID-19 crisis, although we do not think DJs can or should play for free forever.</p>

      <p>DJs receive 100% of the profit until we are able to pay them a reasonable rate. We also provide a method to tip DJs.</p>

      <p>"Profit" means subscriptions minus real costs of running the platform: we take no pay ourselves until DJs are being paid fairly. This means that when we have 1000 subscribers, we can pay DJs $25/hr.</p>

      <p>Eventually, we will need wages ourselves to keep this running. But the majority of your subscription fee will *always* go towards the performers.</p>
    
    </article>

    <article class="question">
      <h3>What does the schedule look like?</h3>

      <p>We will launch with a 40 hour per week schedule (9-5pm UTC-5), but eventually hope to run 24/7 when our resources allow, so that our stream works for everyone's workweek.</p>

      <p>We also hope to eventually open other "floors" in our club that expand beyond electronic music, as our user base grows.</p>
    
    </article>
    <article class="question">
      <h3>Who will perform? What will it sound like?</h3>

      <p>
        We hope to fill our schedule with DJs both known and unknown. In the meantime, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5tjmaiBHDU7AoitcucfDok?si=3uMU3VtSTFmn01NG_WHw3Q" target="_blank">we've created a Spotify playlist</a> to give you an idea of what to expect.
      </p>

      <p>
        We are currently building our roster. If you're interested in performing, <a href="apply.html">please fill out an application</a>.
      </p>

    <article class="question">
      <h3>But I already pay for Spotify and can get all the DJ sets I want on YouTube!</h3>

      <p>
        Spotify pays artists ~$0.003 per play and most of your subscription fee goes to paying major record labels who have entire departments devoted to finding new ways to avoid paying artists fairly.
      </p>

      <p>
        YouTube pays channels even less per view, and the ad revenue from YouTube videos goes to the channel, not the performer.
      </p>

      <p>
        And if you're looking for 40 hours of great music to listen to every week, eventually you're going to run out of RA podcasts and Boiler Room sets. :)
      </p>

    <article class="question">
      <h3>What about after the quarantine?</h3>

      <p>
        Although the current conditions of our world necessitate new streams of income for DJs & musicians, post-pandemic there will still be a lot of people who want a live stream of music during their work day, and there will still be a lot of DJs with free time during those hours. We hope to be a reliable income stream for DJs until the singularity.
      </p>
    </article>

    <article class="question">
      <h3>How do I help?</h3>

      <p>
        We would love to talk with anyone in the scene — performers, clubs, labels, record stores, promoters, institutions, media outlets. <a href="mailto:hi@925.fm">Email us</a> if you are interested and we'll figure out how to work together.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you run a live-streaming platform, we could use a partnership to keep costs low.
      </p>

      <p>If you are a DJ and would like to play, <a href="apply.html">fill out our DJ application</a> and we'll be in touch.</p>

      <p>
        And lastly — to pay DJs $25/hr, we just need 1000 users. To pay DJs $100/hr, we need 5000 users.
      </p>

      <p>
        Be one of them, and tell your friends.
